Thanks for checking out my webpage

<h2 style="color:blue;"><u>About Me:</u></h2>

<h2 style="color:blue;"><u>Background:</u></h2> I am from Jharkhand and currently living at Banaglore from last 2.5 years.I belongs to a middle class family. I did my B.Tech from Punjab in 2013 and joined Paytm,Noida as my first company.

<h2 style="color:blue;"><u>Professional Info:</u></h2> Paytm gave me a chance to start working with Linux and that was my first
		      interaction but later on started loving it.Moving on I did RHCE and RHCSA certification from Newtwork Nuts Delhi and started deep work in Linux and 
		      Bash Scripting.I automated most of the manual works and got appreciations
		      from team and manager.<br/>After 1 year I took next step of my career and joined 
		      CSS Corp Pvt Ltd in Mayâ€™2015,Chennai.I got selected for our Bangalore client
		      InMobi and shifted here.<br/>When I joined here my profile was NOC (montioring 		      plus L1/L2 level troubleshooting).During this period I started interaction with 		     Python and became FAN of this language.First interaction with Python languages		     was like a cave, every stage a new surprise.Thenafter I started writing small 			     Python scripts and in the meantime my Manager offered me a project to automate
		     Grid-Failure job re-run tool.<br/>It was bit challeging for me but I accepted and started
		     working on it.I started spending whole day (continuosly 4 days) in office to get an idea about to present Python over webpage and finally got succedded with CGI scripting.At that stage CGI was boom for me I made that project with CGI,HTML, CSS,Python,Apache and it was greatly successful and appreciable. 
		     In the same time I created one more project to automate Outage Communication.
		     Thenafter I started working on Python+Web Developement with Django and got
 		      another project to create a webapplication for our Techstop team.It was a great opportunity for me to show my talent to client and I completed this with Python,Django,HTML,CSS,LDAP,Jira-API,JS etc.Techstop project was also great successful and appreciable.In October 2016 my Manager promoted me to Infra team where I started working for Server management,Automation,Developement and more.
<br/><br/>After moving to Infra team I automated server management tasks with racadm,ipmitool scripting,Fabric modules for node level automation.I developed two web tool for Infra team one for to get Hardware level info with ipmitool,Python,Django and more and other was Ad-Tracker. 
		
		    <br/></br>Little big intro but hope you would have liked.
			<br/>
		   Currently I am working on Data Science,ML and more to get deep knowledge
		   and get an another step of my professional career.
